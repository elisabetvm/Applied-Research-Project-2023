# Applied-Research-Project-2023
Course work at University of Helsinki, Teacher: Kelsey Q. Wright

My paper for this course asked the question: 
Is the sex, work time and contract type of workers related to the amount of sick leave (as a proxy for wellbeing) that they take? 
Many studies show evidence for the impact of work time to wellbeing and health. 
There is an increasing trend where possible to move towards less work hours. 
This is true particularly for women, who seem to be more affected by the adverse effects of working too long hours.

So, to answer my research question I utilized data from the Ty√∂olobarometri 2020.
Stata 17 was utilized for the analysis.

In this repository you will find the do files I utilized for my analysis.
